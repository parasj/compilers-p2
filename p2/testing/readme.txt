Provided are:
1. grade.sh - a script you can use to test your parser and determine your grade
2. tests - a folder containing tiger programs and the expected s-expression representation of those programs or the location of the first character of a token stream that couldn't be matched to a valid production

Simply copy your compiler.jar file to this directory and run ./grade.sh in your terminal (you may have to chmod +x to make the grade shell script executable)
